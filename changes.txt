Sep 26, 2019
 - NOTES for consolidated annotations contain info allowing to deconsolidate the annotation into multiple ones
   (to be used in GAF generator: GAF spec allows only one PMID in REFERENCE column)
 - renamed to GoNonRatAnnotationPipeline

Jun 14, 2019
 - improved summary email

Version 2.4.7: Apr 22, 2019
 - fixed data source for HUMAN, DOG and PIG

Version 2.4.6: Jan 30, 2019
 - added support for pig

Version 2.4.5: Dec 19, 2018
 - updated dependencies (FULL_ANNOT table changed)

Version 2.4.4: Oct 30, 2018
 - stale annotations are now processed by species, to be more informative

Version 2.4.3: Sep 18, 2018
 - moved code from subversion to github

Version 2.4.2: Mar 2, 2018
 - added generation of inferred ISO annotations for RAT from manual chinchilla GO annotations

Version 2.4.1: Mar 1, 2018
 - added processing of GO annotations for DOG

Version 2.4.0: Feb 28, 2018
 - substantial logic upgrade:
   1) for given species, multiple database sources could be processed (previously only 1 source was allowed)
   2) duplicate annotations are merged by combining their XREF_SOURCE and NOTES fields
   3) NOTES field is set only to information that does not appear in XREF_SOURCE field

Version 2.3.6: Feb 12, 2018
 - tuned up reporting

Version 2.3.5: Jan 23, 2018
 - delete threshold for stale annotations is set in properties file: currently 5%

Version 2.3.4: Jan 22, 2018
 - implemented DATA_SRC conversion for incoming data: 'UniProt' -> 'UniProtKB'
 - implemented 5% delete threshold for stale annotations

Version 2.3.3: Jul 10, 2017
 - disabled automatic refresh of CREATED_DATE fields for IEA annotations older than 9 months
   per RGDD-1194, annotation created date should never be adjusted, because it messes up with the notification system

Version 2.3.2: Jul 3, 2017
 - upgraded from ANT to GRADLE
 - implemented automatic refresh of CREATED_DATE fields for IEA annotations older than 9 months

 Version 2.3.1: Feb 8, 2017

Version 2.3.0: Jan 16, 2017
  - changed data source for human (remote dir ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/go/gene-associations/):
    OLD: gene_association.goa_human.gz
    NEW: goa_human.gaf.gz
        +goa_human_complex.gaf.gz
        +goa_human_isoform.gaf.gz
        +goa_human_rna.gaf.gz

Version 2.2.8: May 13, 2016
  - new annotations: creation date is no longer read from incoming data, but it is set to current machine timestamp
    this is done to make myRgd annotation watcher work correctly

Version 2.2.7: Jan 26, 2016
  - code refactoring for logging (exclusive use of log4j) and DAO (better reuse of rgdcore)

Version 2.2.6: Oct 21, 2015
  - improved handling of FULL_ANNOT updates

Version 2.2.5: Sep 28, 2015
  - skipping self-referencing annotations

Version 2.2.4: Jan 7, 2015
  - refactored code, updated jars, added logging of deleted annotations

Version 2.2.3: Jul 11, 2014
  - annotations skipped for IPI annotations to catalytic activity terms

Version 2.2.2: Jun 23, 2014

Version 2.2.1: Jun 18, 2014
  - updated rgdcore.jar; annotations are skipped for top level GO terms, as specified in
    http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation_qc.shtml#GO_AR:0000008

Version 2.2.0: Apr 21, 2014
  - updated rgdcore.jar; CREATED_DATE updated in addition to LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - per RGDD-913

Version 2.1.3: Dec 28, 2012
  - updated rgdcore.jar: unique index on FULL_ANNOT table no longer has fields TERm and EXP_RGD_ID    - per RGDD-555

Version 2.1.2: Nov 30, 2012
  - moved code to download input files from shell script into java

Version 2.1.1: August 7, 2012
  - fixed log4j script and cron script
  - if incoming GO term is not found in RGD, it will be reported and the pipeline won't break
  - fixed logic for not processing all annotations

Version 2.1: June 25, 2012
  - refactored code to reuse as much dao code from rgdcore as possible
  - enabled caching and parallelization to improve significantly pipeline throughput
  - changed model from 'drop and reload' to 'incremental update' to significantly improve performance

Version 2.0: June 12, 2012
  - moved hard-coded parameters for pipeline into AppConfigure.xml file
  - refactored code to use RGDManagementDAO from rgdcore to handle rgd id history
